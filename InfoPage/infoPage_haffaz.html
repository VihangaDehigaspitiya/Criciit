<h1 align="center">Information Page Design</h1>
<hr color="black">

<h2><b>Accessibility</b></h2>

<ul type="square">
    <li>The main page is designed in a simple and elegant way that the user wont be confused.</li>
    <li>I have created two different stylesheets for the navigation bar and main page.</li>
    <li>Since the navigation bar should be used in every almost every web page its much more easier to have a seperate stylesheet.</li>
    <li>The navigation bar allowas the user to surf around the website without getting drowned.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Forms are usually dull to see.</li>
    <li>BUt with a little dose of css i was able to give it a interesting look</li>

</ul>
<br>
<hr>

<h2><b>Typhography</b></h2>
<ul type="square">
    <li>Sans-Serif is frequently used in the main page because it gives a classy look with the blend of the reddish background.</li>
    <li>I thought of having a stylish navigation bar but still having the clarity it has the most suitable fonts were "Lucida Console", "Lucida Sans Typewriter", "Bitstream Vera Sans Mono"</li>
    <li>Different font sizes were given to diffent sections in order to maintain a clear idea on the website</li>
    <br>
    <li>I didn't use many font types in the form in order to make it look more professional</li>
    <li>The form uses mostly the default font families.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<hr>

<h2><b>Color Balance / Combination</b></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Red and Black was chosen as the theme color since these color's represents a professional look for the website.</li>
    <li>The background color represents the theme very well, its a black and red gradient.</li>
    <li>The navigation bar has a hover effect of blue color which also blends well with the theme.</li>
    <li>I have used white fonts in the nav bar because it looks amazing with and without the hover effect</li>
    <li>But in the form the background colors are fixed so i settled with black color which is easier to identify.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<hr>

<h2><b>Gestalt Principles for grouping</b></h2>
<ul>
    <p><b>Similarity</b></p>
    <li>The textboxes in the form has the same hover effect in order to represent their similarity</li>
    <li>Also the navigations links share the same properties</li>
    <li>In the main page same type of contents share the same background</li>

    <p><b>Proximity</b></p>
    <li>The Gestalt law of proximity states that "objects or shapes that are close to one another appear to form groups".</li>
    <li>Labels in top of the text boxes </li>
    <li>Contents are well oragnized according to their types and uses.</li>

    <p><b>Closure</b></p>
    <li>The form is also developed sepereately where the content can be easily identified. </li>

    <p><b>Good Form</b></p>
    <li>The principle of good form refers to the tendency to group together forms of similar shape, pattern, color etc.</li>
    <li>The navigation bar groups the whole site together</li>
</ul>
